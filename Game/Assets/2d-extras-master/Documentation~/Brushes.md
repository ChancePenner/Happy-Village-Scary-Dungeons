# Scriptable Brushes



Scriptable Brushes are Grid Brushes which can paint items based on the position and conditions of the targeted position on the GridLayout. The paint behavior can be modified by the current editing Tool selected, such as Erase or Floodfill.



Here are some implementations of Scriptables Brushes which can help save time in designing your Tilemap:



- [Game Object Brush](GameObjectBrush.md)

- [Coordinate Brush](CoordinateBrush.md)
- [Line Brush](LineBrush.md)
